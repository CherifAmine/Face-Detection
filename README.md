# Face-Detection
In this post I am sharing face detection using Haar waterfalls in OpenCV and Python.
You need to download the trained classifier XML file (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml), which is available in OpenCvâ€™s GitHub repository ( https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades ). Save it to your working location.
